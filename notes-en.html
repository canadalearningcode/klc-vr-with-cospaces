        #Kids Learning Code: Virtual Reality with CoSpaces

        <br>
        ##Using Cospaces

        CoSpaces Edu is an intuitive educational technology enabling students and teachers to easily build their own 3D creations, animate them with code (using block coding) and explore them in Virtual or Augmented Reality. During this workshop, projects are saved online at <a href="https://cospaces.io/edu/">cospaces.io/edu</a>

        <br>
        ##Creating a Teacher's Account in CoSpaces

        You are going to need to set up a teacher's account for your Chapter or Code Mobile. Go to <a href="https://cospaces.io/edu/">cospaces.io/edu</a>

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/Homepage.png" alt="slide">

        Create an account as a teacher, follow the prompts (you can "log in with" Google using your Chapter/Code Mobile emails)

        **Or if your Chapter or Code Mobile already has an account you can just sign in using your Chapter/Code Mobile's log in information

        <br>
        ##Clearing out past students
        It is important to ensure that all previous students are removed from your teacher's account prior to each workshop, as these accounts only allow for a maximum of 30 students at a time. Once you are signed into your CoSpaces account go to <strong>Manage Users</strong>. You need to select all students using the top check-box, then under <strong>Actions</strong> choose <strong>Remove from License Plan</strong>.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/removestudents.png" alt="slide">

        <br>
        ##Getting Started in CoSpaces
        Go through the slides and notes and ensure you're comfortable using CoSpaces. If there isn't already a project in the <strong>My CoSpaces</strong> section of your teacher's account, spend a little time creating a simple space and add in a few characters and objects.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/simplespace.png" alt="slide">

        You can only have one "space" or project at a time. But each space allows for multiple scenes. So if there already is a "space" or project started you can simple add a new scene. To do this, open the project and in the upper left of the screen there is a scene icon you can open. Once open you can add a new scene at the bottom.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/sceneicon.png" alt="slide">

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/newscene.png" alt="slide">

        <br>
        ##Setting Up your Class in CoSpacesApp
        You will also need to ensure to create a class for your students. Go to <strong>My Classes</strong> and create a class.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/createclass.png" alt="slide">

        A class code will appear, make a note of this in order to share with your learners when they need to sign into CoSpaces. You can also look it up again by selecting the class, the class code will be on the right hand side of the screen.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/classcode.png" alt="slide">

        If there is already a class created, just ensure there are no students by selecting <strong>Students</strong>. It should say there are no students in the class yet. *If there are still students in the class, repeat the step about clearing out past students.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/nostudents.png" alt="slide">

        <br>
        ##Setting Up and Using the VR headsets

        Make sure to go through slides 27-29 throughly to ensure you know how to set up the VR headsets. During the mentor huddle, make sure to walk all the mentors through the process as well. It is important that everyone is comfortable with the process in order for the demos to go smoothly. Learners will be sharing VR headsets during the demo process. The mentors will be helping ensure all the learners can quickly use the QR codes to sign into their projects and get the VR headsets working to maximize the demo time.

        If you are using different VR headsets than the ones provided to the Chapters and Code Mobiles (ie, a learner brings their own) please note that not all VR headsets work the same. If the additional headsets DO NOT have a "click" button they will not be able to do all the features of the workshop.

        <strong>Important Note</strong> - using VR headsets can cause motion sickness. If learners experiences discomfort during the demo process have them demo their projects without the VR headsets and without using the "split screen" mode. Use the icon in the blue circle and tilt and move the phone around.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/notvricon.png" alt="slide">

        <strong>Important Note</strong> - If at any point the learners projects are not responding or loading properly try logging the learners out and then back into their accounts. This tends to fix any issues that arise. You may need to try it several times.

        <br>

              </tr>

        </table>


        <br>

        ##Create-Along

        * Ensure you have already created a class in the CoSpaces account, or you have removed previous students from the class.
        * Have your class code ready. You can verify your class code by going into <strong>My Classes</strong> and selecting your class and checking the right-hand side of the screen for the class code.
        * Share the class code, either on a white board or your screen, for the sign up process.
        * To help the sign in process go smoothly, its recommended you have the learners use a naming convention to create their user names and provide them with a simple password (123456). User name conventions (ie. firstname-city-year  OR firstname-school-year)
        * While working through the Create-Along, open up a new CoSpaces space in another tab and create after each step - OR -
        * You can use the slides more as a reference and teach in your CoSpaces project. That way the learners will be able to see in action all the different tools and tricks.
        * Don't forget to click on Play (play icon in top right corner) to preview in order to see your space develop as you go.
        * While NOT in Play Mode, click on the camera and show how the field of view lights up. Make sure to show the kids that if you want to see your objects as soon as play mode starts then they have to be in the field of view of the camera. You can click on Play Mode to ensure your objects are in a good position.

                  Walk the class through selecting an environment from the preset options. Hold off letting them choose one until after you have shown how to add a character. Let them do both steps at once. </td>

                <td> Show how to choose a character and how to go about customizing it. The left click menu allows you to move and resize your character. Take a moment and show how each works. Make sure to point out right click versus regular click! The right click menu allows you to customize your character more. Show a few examples of changing things in the 'materials' options. Give them at least 5 minutes to select their environment and character.
                  <br><br>
                *This is a good place to show the learners about the camera's field of view. If you place your character outside the camera's field of view you won't see your character immediately when you press play

              <tr>
                <td><img src="framework/img/workshop/slides/23.png" alt="slide"></td>
                <td> Make sure to point out to the learners that these uploaded objects can't be edited in appearance in the same way. If you try to change the "materials" aka colour it will change to all one colour. It may be a good idea to show them this on your example.
              </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><img src="framework/img/workshop/slides/24.png" alt="slide"></td>

                <br><br>
                Then show them how to make something using just the building blocks!
                <br><br>
                Important note about grouping objects!! Grouping objects can be tricky. Make sure not to group the items together until all objects are exactly the way you would want them. Make sure to adjust the colours (AKA materials) BEFORE you group items together. You cannot adjust the colours after items have been grouped together, even if you ungroup them!!
                <br>
                <br>
                If your grouping isn't working the way you want, try using the undo button to go back and try again, but this time try selecting the objects in a different order before you group them. Order matters, but it depends on what you are trying to create. Sometimes you have to experiment to get it right.
                <br>
                <br>
                ***Before the workshop make sure to test out grouping two objects in order to demonstrate to the learners.
              </td>
              </tr>

        </table>

        <br>
        ##Work Session
        * Give learners time to create their VR spaces (35-45 mins)
        * If possible have a timer visible for the learners so they can keep track of how much time remains.
        * Go through the STEPS, then leave the STEPS slide up on the screen
        * Check in with the group every 10 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their ideas whenever possible.
        * <strong>Very Important Step</strong> - While the learners are creating their spaces, you will need to go into your account and go to <strong>Manage Users</strong>. Then select ALL students, then go to <strong>Actions</strong> then select <strong>Allow Sharing</strong> This allows the students to create QR Codes for their demos.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/manageusers.png" alt="slide"><img src="framework/img/workshop/allowsharing.png" alt="slide">

        * Save at least 15 for the first demos. You will need around 5 mins to demonstrate how to set up the phone and VR headsets to the group and then 5 mins for each learner to test.
        * Give the learners about 5 mins each to test out their creation. It will give them a sense of how what they created relates to the project in VR space. This will be helpful in the next work session as they are adding code. They will have a better sense of how things in the VR headsets differ from on the computer screen.

        ##Code-Along

        * You can use the slides in this section more as a guide and teach more from your CoSpaces project screen.
        * Make sure to point out where the different features are on the screen, then highlight to the learners how you can use the categories to help find the different types of blocks. Ask the learners which blocks to use for different actions!
        * Demonstrate how you click and drag blocks around the space, including dragging blocks to the trash can.
        * Highlight how the blocks click together and come apart.
        * Make sure to show the learners how to "play" their projects to test and see their code in action. Ideally, do this step after each new block is added to illustrate each new change.
        * While working through the Code-Along, keep your CoSpaces project open in another tab and add one or two of each type of code block (Transform, Action, Events, Control) - Click on Play (play icon) to preview
        * A quick note about the free version of CoSpaces. The coding is limited in this version. There aren't a lot of available blocks and  code blocks CANNOT run in parallel with each other. Instead the learners need to code it more like a linear story (one things happens, followed by another thing, and then another, etc.)
        * Also verify that your VR headsets have a button for clicking on things when wearing them. If they do not have a button, the Event block (When this object is Clicked) will NOT work.

                You may need to use the timing blocks at the beginning of your project if it is supposed to start as soon as you press play. Think about it. When getting the VR headset set up you have to press play, press the VR icon, place the phone in the headset. That all takes time. So you may miss certain actions before you have your headsets ready to go.

        <br>
        ##Work Session
        * Give learners time to code their ideal learning environment (45 mins)
        * Go through the suggestions, then leave the suggestions slide up on the screen
        * Again this is another opportunity to use a timer on your screen so the learners can keep track of the remaining work time.
        * Check in with the group every 10 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their ideas whenever possible.
        * Since the learners with have the VR headsets and know how to use them the Demos can really be happening throughout this time. As they code and make changes they can check them on the VR headsets. Suggest leaving about 15 minutes for the learners to share their VR headsets with the other learners and test out other creations.

        <table style="font-size:2rem;">
            <tr>
              <tr>
                <td><img src="framework/img/workshop/slides/37.png" alt="slide"></td>
                <td></td>

                <td>Give them time to code their worlds.</td>
              </tr>

        </table>
        <br>

        ##Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        #Kids Learning Code: Virtual Reality with CoSpaces

        <br>
        ##Using Cospaces

        CoSpaces Edu is an intuitive educational technology enabling students and teachers to easily build their own 3D creations, animate them with code (using block coding) and explore them in Virtual or Augmented Reality. During this workshop, projects are saved online at <a href="https://cospaces.io/edu/">cospaces.io/edu</a>

        <br>
        ##Creating a Teacher's Account in CoSpaces

        You are going to need to set up a teacher's account for your Chapter or Code Mobile. Go to <a href="https://cospaces.io/edu/">cospaces.io/edu</a>

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/Homepage.png" alt="slide">

        Create an account as a teacher, follow the prompts (you can "log in with" Google using your Chapter/Code Mobile emails)

        **Or if your Chapter or Code Mobile already has an account you can just sign in using your Chapter/Code Mobile's log in information

        <br>
        ##Clearing out past students
        It is important to ensure that all previous students are removed from your teacher's account prior to each workshop, as these accounts only allow for a maximum of 30 students at a time. Once you are signed into your CoSpaces account go to <strong>Manage Users</strong>. You need to select all students using the top check-box, then under <strong>Actions</strong> choose <strong>Remove from License Plan</strong>.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/removestudents.png" alt="slide">

        <br>
        ##Getting Started in CoSpaces
        Go through the slides and notes and ensure you're comfortable using CoSpaces. If there isn't already a project in the <strong>My CoSpaces</strong> section of your teacher's account, spend a little time creating a simple space and add in a few characters and objects.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/simplespace.png" alt="slide">

        You can only have one "space" or project at a time. But each space allows for multiple scenes. So if there already is a "space" or project started you can simple add a new scene. To do this, open the project and in the upper left of the screen there is a scene icon you can open. Once open you can add a new scene at the bottom.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/sceneicon.png" alt="slide">

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/newscene.png" alt="slide">

        <br>
        ##Setting Up your Class in CoSpacesApp
        You will also need to ensure to create a class for your students. Go to <strong>My Classes</strong> and create a class.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/createclass.png" alt="slide">

        A class code will appear, make a note of this in order to share with your learners when they need to sign into CoSpaces. You can also look it up again by selecting the class, the class code will be on the right hand side of the screen.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/classcode.png" alt="slide">

        If there is already a class created, just ensure there are no students by selecting <strong>Students</strong>. It should say there are no students in the class yet. *If there are still students in the class, repeat the step about clearing out past students.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/nostudents.png" alt="slide">

        <br>
        ##Setting Up and Using the VR headsets

        Make sure to go through slides 27-29 throughly to ensure you know how to set up the VR headsets. During the mentor huddle, make sure to walk all the mentors through the process as well. It is important that everyone is comfortable with the process in order for the demos to go smoothly. Learners will be sharing VR headsets during the demo process. The mentors will be helping ensure all the learners can quickly use the QR codes to sign into their projects and get the VR headsets working to maximize the demo time.

        If you are using different VR headsets than the ones provided to the Chapters and Code Mobiles (ie, a learner brings their own) please note that not all VR headsets work the same. If the additional headsets DO NOT have a "click" button they will not be able to do all the features of the workshop.

        <strong>Important Note</strong> - using VR headsets can cause motion sickness. If learners experiences discomfort during the demo process have them demo their projects without the VR headsets and without using the "split screen" mode. Use the icon in the blue circle and tilt and move the phone around.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/notvricon.png" alt="slide">

        <strong>Important Note</strong> - If at any point the learners projects are not responding or loading properly try logging the learners out and then back into their accounts. This tends to fix any issues that arise. You may need to try it several times.

              </tr>

        </table>


        <br>

        ##Create-Along

        * Ensure you have already created a class in the CoSpaces account, or you have removed previous students from the class.
        * Have your class code ready. You can verify your class code by going into <strong>My Classes</strong> and selecting your class and checking the right-hand side of the screen for the class code.
        * Share the class code, either on a white board or your screen, for the sign up process.
        * To help the sign in process go smoothly, its recommended you have the learners use a naming convention to create their user names and provide them with a simple password (123456). User name conventions (ie. firstname-city-year  OR firstname-school-year)
        * While working through the Create-Along, open up a new CoSpaces space in another tab and create after each step - OR -
        * You can use the slides more as a reference and teach in your CoSpaces project. That way the learners will be able to see in action all the different tools and tricks.
        * Don't forget to click on Play (play icon in top right corner) to preview in order to see your space develop as you go.
        * While NOT in Play Mode, click on the camera and show how the field of view lights up. Make sure to show the kids that if you want to see your objects as soon as play mode starts then they have to be in the field of view of the camera. You can click on Play Mode to ensure your objects are in a good position.

              </tr>
        </table>

        <br>
        ##Work Session
        * Give learners time to create their VR spaces (35-45 mins)
        * If possible have a timer visible for the learners so they can keep track of how much time remains.
        * Go through the STEPS, then leave the STEPS slide up on the screen
        * Check in with the group every 10 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their ideas whenever possible.
        * <strong>Very Important Step</strong> - While the learners are creating their spaces, you will need to go into your account and go to <strong>Manage Users</strong>. Then select ALL students, then go to <strong>Actions</strong> then select <strong>Allow Sharing</strong> This allows the students to create QR Codes for their demos.

        <img src="framework/img/workshop/manageusers.png" alt="slide"><img src="framework/img/workshop/allowsharing.png" alt="slide">

        * Save at least 15 for the first demos. You will need around 5 mins to demonstrate how to set up the phone and VR headsets to the group and then 5 mins for each learner to test.
        * Give the learners about 5 mins each to test out their creation. It will give them a sense of how what they created relates to the project in VR space. This will be helpful in the next work session as they are adding code. They will have a better sense of how things in the VR headsets differ from on the computer screen.

                Important note about grouping objects!! Grouping objects can be tricky. Make sure not to group the items together until all objects are exactly the way you would want them. Make sure to adjust the colours (AKA materials) BEFORE you group items together. You cannot adjust the colours after items have been grouped together, even if you ungroup them!!
                <br>
                <br>
                If your grouping isn't working the way you want, try using the undo button to go back and try again, but this time try selecting the objects in a different order before you group them. Order matters, but it depends on what you are trying to create. Sometimes you have to experiment to get it right.

                ***Before the workshop make sure to test out grouping two objects in order to demonstrate to the learners.

        ##Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.
