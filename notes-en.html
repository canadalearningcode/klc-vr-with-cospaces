        #Using Cospaces

        CoSpaces Edu is an intuitive educational technology enabling students and teachers to easily build their own 3D creations, animate them with code (using block coding) and explore them in Virtual or Augmented Reality. During this workshop, projects are saved online at <a href="https://cospaces.io/edu/">cospaces.io/edu</a> Here are a few resources to get you started:

        * Processing <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Reference</a>
        * <a href="https://processing.org/download">Download Processing</a> (backup to online version)

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Kids Learning Code workshop: Virtual Reality with CoSpaces! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        #Create-Along

        * Go through each step using the slides while the group follows along.
        * If there is a whiteboard, write down the class code for the sign up process.
        * While working through the Code-Along, open up a new CoSpaces project in another tab and create after each step - Click on Play (play icon) to preview
        * While in NOT in Play Mode click on the camera and show how the field of view lights up. Make sure to show the kids that if you want to see your objects then they have to be in the field of view. You can click of Play Mode to ensure your objects are in a good position.

        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        <br>
        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 35 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!

    #Using Processing

    Processing builds upon the Java language, and is often used in electronic arts, new media art, and visual design. The application itself allows anyone to code in something called a Sketchbook, where programs can be saved and previewed instantly. During this workshop, sketches are saved online at <a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/">openprocessing.org</a> using Processing.js. Here are a few resources to get you started:

    * Processing <a href="https://processing.org/reference/">Reference</a>

    #Code-Along

    * Go through each step using the slides (after "Let's Get Coding!") while the group follows along.
    * Make sure everyone selects the "Processing.js" Mode (top, right under Settings)
    * If there is a whiteboard, write down main functions as you go, as a reference for the work session (or have a mentor help out with this). <i>Review keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+C, ctrl+V, ctrl+F) and post these near the front, as well.</i>
    * While working through the Code-Along, open up openprocessing.org in another tab and paste/type the text after each step - Click on Run (play icon) to preview
    * Have the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ngXh74VIzJTNLKaIPI4FnBT4j9XeuSDLPza8vH0divs/edit?usp=sharing">Code-Along Challenges</a> handy for mentors to give to learners that are ahead
    * Show learners how to save their work ("Save" > Name project > "Submit") and remind them to save often!

          <br><br>
          Finally, if we want to reset the paintbrush size back to normal, we can make "grow" go back to equaling 1 when we clear the background, in "draw." (grow = 1;) </td>

    #Work Session

    * Give learners time to remix and extend the Paintbrush Code-Along activity (15-20 mins)
    * Choose an activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wlzpvzc8O-z4DXQAeXOz7b3xDmDPLxwsq_DQqOIYM_o/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Emoji Art. (If you are using another activity, be sure to paste the steps and solution into the slides ahead of time)
    * Get learners started by creating a new project (Click on the OpenProcessing icon, then “+ Create a Sketch”)
    * Get the project started code-along style - have volunteers come up and show the group how to set up the sketch (e.g.)
    * Go through the STEPS, then leave the STEPS slide up on the screen
    * Check in with the group every 10 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their solutions whenever possible.
    * Remind learners to save often!
    * Leave the last 10 mins for learners to share their projects with each other. Recommended: Have volunteers present their projects up front. If you're short on time, have a Gallery Walk, where learners open projects on their computers and walk around to see each other's work.

    #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

    If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

    #Closing Script

    Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 46 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

    You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

    If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

    Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

    Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
