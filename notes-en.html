        #Using Cospaces

        CoSpaces Edu is an intuitive educational technology enabling students and teachers to easily build their own 3D creations, animate them with code (using block coding) and explore them in Virtual or Augmented Reality. During this workshop, projects are saved online at <a href="https://cospaces.io/edu/">cospaces.io/edu</a> Here are a few resources to get you started:

        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Kids Learning Code workshop: Virtual Reality with CoSpaces! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 30 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

                    <li><strong>Try your best</strong>: Even the best coders have trouble sometimes, so we don’t expect you to do everything perfectly the first time, but make sure you’re trying your best. Don’t be afraid to try things out and make mistakes!</td>

        * Ensure you have paper and pencils for each of the learners ready for this step.

        </table>


        <br>

        #Create-Along

        * Ensure you have already created a class in the CoSpaces account, or there is already one with enough open seats for all the learners and have the class code written down.
        * Share the class code, either on a white board or your screen, for the sign up process.
        * While working through the Create-Along, open up a new CoSpaces space in another tab and create after each step - OR -
        * You can use the slides more as a reference and teach in your CoSpaces project. That way the learners will be able to see in action all the different tools and tricks.
        * Don't forget to click on Play (play icon in top right corner) to preview in order to see your space develop as you go.
        * While in NOT in Play Mode click on the camera and show how the field of view lights up. Make sure to show the kids that if you want to see your objects as soon as play mode starts then they have to be in the field of view or the camera. You can click on Play Mode to ensure your objects are in a good position.

                <br>
                *You will have to create a class in advance in order to have a class code available. There is a create a class button inside your 'My Classes' menu

Make sure to point out right click versus regular click! The right click menu allows you to customize your character more. Show a few examples of changing things in the 'materials' options. Give them at least 5 minutes to select their environment and character.
                  <br><br>
                *This is a good place to show the learners about the camera's field of view. If you place your character outside the camera's field of view you won't see your character immediately when you press play

                <br><br>
                Important note for the learners!! Make sure to adjust the colours (AKA materials) BEFORE you group items together. You cannot adjust the colours after items have been grouped together!!

              </tr>

        </table>

        <br>
        #Work Session
        * Give learners time to create their VR spaces (45-60 mins)
        * If possible have a timer visible for the learners so they can keep track of how much time remains.
        * Go through the STEPS, then leave the STEPS slide up on the screen
        * Check in with the group every 10 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their ideas whenever possible.
        * Save at least 15 for the first demos. You will need around 5 mins to demonstrate how to set up the phone and VR headsets to the group and then 5 mins for each learner to test.
        * If the learners make changes to their spaces on the computers and want to see the changes in the VR headsets, then will need to reopen their spaces on the phone. They simply press the "Home" button in the top left corner, then choose their space again.h
        * Give the learners about 5 mins each to test out their creation. It will give them a sense of how what they created relates to the project in VR space. This will be helpful in the next work sessions as they are adding code. They will have a better sense of how things in the VR headsets differ from on the computer screen.

        <br>
        #Code-Along

        * Go through each slide (after "Let's Get Coding!") while the group follows along.
        * While working through the Code-Along, keep your CoSpaces project open in another tab and add one or two of each type of code block (Transform, Action, Events, Control) - Click on Play (play icon) to preview
        * A quick note about the free version of CoSpaces. The coding is limited in this version. There aren't a lot of available blocks and  code blocks CANNOT run in parallel with each other. Instead the learners need to code it more like a linear story (one things happens, followed by another thing, and then another, etc.)
        * Also verify that your VR headsets have a button for clicking on things when wearing them. If they do not have a button, the Event block (When this object is Clicked) will NOT work.

        #Work Session
        * Give learners time to code their ideal learning environment (45-60 mins)
        * Go through the suggestions, then leave the suggestions slide up on the screen
        * Again this another oppotunity to use a timer on your screen so the learners can keep track of the remaining work time.
        * Check in with the group every 10 minutes to see if there are any questions. Have learners come up and share their ideas whenever possible.
        * Since the learners with have the VR headsets and know how to use them the Demos can really be happening throughout this time. As they code and make changes they can check them on the VR headsets. Suggest leaving about 15 minutes for the learners to share their VR headsets with the other learners and test out other creations.

        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 36 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site kidslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
